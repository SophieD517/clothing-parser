I'm making some kind of web app situation that tracks the prices of goods and notifies you when it goes on sale/the price changes. 

Currently, I'm using GAP as a test case. Assuming the price is constant across sizes (I haven't seen any examples otherwise). I have the back-end together, but I'm still working on an interface or some kind of plugin to google chrome?

Compatibility needs Beautiful Soup, NumPy, not sure what else at the moment.
