I'm making some kind of web app situation that tracks the prices of goods and notifies you when it goes on sale/the price changes. 

Currently, I'm using GAP as a test case. Assuming the price is constant across sizes (I haven't seen any examples otherwise). I have the back-end together, but I'm still working on an interface or some kind of plugin to google chrome?

Compatibility needs Beautiful Soup, NumPy, not sure what else at the moment.

kind of a to-do list:
- standardize the outputs across different cases
- set up long-term testing (sending emails to myself with prices)
- write a crude front-end
- generalize to a couple of other brands (old navy, jcrew, h&m, uniqlo)
- get some test subjects
- generalize to all (most) brands
- get a beautiful frontend together
